# Contributing to Alice

- Alice is my highly-experimental side project and I'm still figuring out
  exactly how it will work and what it will be. Now is not the time for
  contributing large or complex features as they will slow down the process of
  rapid prototyping.
- For non-trivial changes please open an issue first so we can discus if it
  makes sense for the project.
- Don't get too attached to your contribution. Alice is still in an exploratory
  stage of development and I frequently delete and reimplement large amounts of
  it.
- Please do not contribute AI-generated code.
